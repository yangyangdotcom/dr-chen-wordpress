It tracks steps, distance in miles, calories burned, stairs climbed and quality of sleep.  It has an app for your smartphone and also comes with a little toggle that goes into you computer that makes the information from the device connect through your wifi also.   All information is then logged into your own webpage which is private on Fitbit.com.  There you can also log your food intake and weight and any other useful information.  I started out setting my goal to walk a minimum of 10,000 steps a day and or at least 4 miles.  But since I have started wearing it I am so motivated by it that I usually walk between 8 to 15 miles a day, most of the time just doing laps around my pool and in my yard or house in bad weather.  I even sleep with it so if I wake up at night to walk to the bathroom those steps count too, every step counts.   I started wearing this following cervical surgery weight gain in Jan. 2014 and it only 3 months I have dropped 25 lbs and that is doing it the healthy way.  Eating healthy and lots of walking.  This is the first time I have ever dieted the healthy way so I am really excited that I was introduced to this website and "The Spectrum" book.  I just started the book and look forward to learning even more about healthy eating and living and hoping to change my lifestyle ways for the better.

It is a new modal that can be launched from the vertical ellipses menu, inspired by Rich Tabor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v9rXLDv-FM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoBlocks implementation</a>. Users can turn individual blocks on/off or even entire sections, such as Common Blocks, Formatting, and Embeds. Block management should help users avoid the bloat that happens when installing block collections with more blocks than they need. </p>\n<p>This version&#8217;s updates to the Cover Block make it possible to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nest other blocks inside of it</a>. Users can now add buttons, paragraphs, and headers to easily create a call to action. It&#8217;s not immediately evident that nesting blocks is possible, despite the floating inserter. It takes a little bit of time to discover that it is available. There are still some quirks with this feature, but overall it makes the Cover Block much more useful than previous versions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-20-at-11.53.48-AM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>A few contributors commenting on the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cover Block&#8217;s nesting PR</a> said that it seems like the work on this iteration is essentially a light version of a section block. They questioned if it might be better to finish the work on the Section block (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#4900</a>) and build from there. Many developers and designers are eagerly awaiting the addition of a Section block to core, which will provide a standard for the plugin and theme industries to build on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the cover block has very specific functionality that the section may not have like the focal point selector,&#8221; Automattic JavaScript engineer Jorge Costa said. &#8220;It is also important to note that the adjustments we make here to the way nesting works will also benefit a future section. This also allows us to test nesting a little bit more, before going to the section block. I expect the section block to be widely used in the community and will probably serve as a basis for many things being built in the future so it is important that we get it right. Exploring in cover will contribute to that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.3 adds an experimental Legacy Widget Block that allows existing WordPress widgets to be added as Gutenberg blocks. It offers a dropdown of available widgets. After selecting one, the block populates that area with the widget&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-20-at-12.49.23-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">improves block outlines for the hover and selected states</a> for a more accessible UI with less distraction.

Negative or positive, they affected you in a way that helped create the person you are.</p>\n<h3>The Early Days</h3>\n<p>Her father said to her, “Jean, you are always welcome but leave your kids at home.” That I will remember until the day I die. Why? We were biracial. My mother (who was White) left her home in Virginia to run away to Cleveland with my father (who was Black, and from West Virginia) to get married. That was in 1956.</p>\n<p>My father left us when I was about 8. Left us high and dry. The only positive thing I remember that he gave me was a typewriter. He said to me, “Teach yourself how to type and you’ll always be able to make a living.” I didn’t realize he “gave me anything” until after he died.</p>\n<p>After my second failed marriage, I moved my Mom in with me because she was ill. That was 2005 and that’s when my journey with WordPress began. I originally started using Joomla but found that it was too cumbersome to keep up-to-date because things needed to be done manually, whereas WordPress had this cool way of updating the plugins right inside the dashboard. I was hooked and left Joomla behind.</p>\n<p>I went back to work full time at one of the local hospitals. But not even a year into it I quit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One morning as I am waiting for the home health aide to arrive, my Mom started to cry and said, “I don’t want to die alone.” I stopped and looked at her and said, “You aren’t going to die alone.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>That day, I got to work and one of the doctor’s pissed me off. I thought about what my Mom said and then starting thinking, “I don’t need this bullshit.” I went to my desk and started packing my things. My co-worker said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I quit.” She said, “What?” I said, “I quit.” The doctor ran out, “What are you doing and where are you going?” I said, “I quit, and you can kiss my ass!”</p>\n<p>I got home too early and my Mom asks, “Why are you home?” I just stood there. She looked at me and said, “Did you quit?” I started laughing, “Yep sure did and told that doctor he could kiss my ass!” She started giggling! “We’ll be okay.” she said.</p>\n<h3>Shifting Gears</h3>\n<p>At that moment I said I must take this hobby of building sites part time, to a full fledge business. I hunkered down in one of the upstairs bedrooms and started to write out my strategy. I had already completed a few small business websites, so I contacted them and from there and word of mouth, my business started to grow.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t until after my Mom died that WordPress really saved my life.</p>\n<p>We were thick as thieves my Mom and me. She almost died having me. I had a sister (she died last April) but she wasn’t close to us and kept mainly to herself. But Mom and I…we were two peas in a pod all the way up to the day she died. I sat with her for five days in hospice and those were some of the longest days and nights of my life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt like someone dropped a weight on my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I felt faint. I felt lost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank God I had Buster, my dog. If it hadn’t been for him, I don’t know what I would have done. There was a night I just couldn’t bear not having my Mom. I had a bottle of Valium and thought, “I should just get it over with, go be with my Mom.” But I looked down at Buster and thought, “No one is going to take better care of him than me. I can’t do that to him.”</p>\n<p>I struggled with depression. Slowly over time I couldn’t function to even work on projects. It finally got to a point where my gas was turned off in the winter and I didn’t have food. I was bundled up with blankets and small heaters in my house to stay warm.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every penny I got, was basically food for Buster. One time I went 5 days without food.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My car was repossessed. It was just crazy. Then I got evicted in mid-January 2013. Yep, evicted.</p>\n<p>My sister, who I wasn’t close to, had received a lump sum of money from Social Security. She sent money to me since I had cared for our Mom all that time by myself. I rented a van, packed up what I could fit in the U-Haul on my own and ended up at an Extended Stay hotel – in the middle of a blizzard. Left all my furniture behind because I didn’t have help.</p>\n<p>I got to the hotel and sat there in the U-Haul. I looked in the mirror and said out loud, “How the fuck did you get here? You don’t even have a pot to piss in!” Buster sitting in the other seat looking at me like I was crazy. That’s when I knew I had hit rock bottom. Depression led me to the bottom.</p>\n<h3>Rising Up</h3>\n<p>But… that was a good thing! I met a lot of wonderful people online. I joined a few WordPress groups, but mainly the StudioPress forum because I had been using their free themes when they were Revolution Two. Then they developed the Genesis Framework. Their old forum was a gold mine of information and the people were awesome. I learned so much from that forum.</p>\n<p>Every day from that point on was WordPress and Genesis. Meeting more people, learning more code. I was completely off the grid in that hotel room! No one here even knew where I was that’s how far off the grid I was. But sometimes, you must do that in order to focus and get back on track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were a lot of bumps in that road the first year, too many to even write out in this essay, but I learned something from each bump.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My business grew from word-of-mouth, I started getting work from people who needed help who saw me on social media and through the forums. Work from people all over the world. It truly was exciting.</p>\n<p>Each day is still WordPress and websites. Learning new things every day. Sitting with Slack windows open and chatting with other WordPress people online. It’s been my entire world since 2013 and pretty much my “Saving Grace” because I feel like I know some people online better than people right here in the same city where I live at. I lived in the hotel for 2 years. Not because I had to but because I wanted to.</p>\n<h3>The Power of Communiity</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community is awesome and giving. The Genesis community is the same. It feels like family and I’ve never met anyone in person but care so much about the people! I would hope that those who know me would feel the same.</p>\n<p>A friend recently shared a quote by the author Dodinsky that started off, “A lot of walking away will do your life good.” But it was the end that really caught my attention and it said, “The more you walk away from things that poison your soul, the healthier your life will be.”</p>\n<p>And that is so true. Healthier in a sense that I walked away from all the bad, negative things and people that were in my space. I was able to grieve and heal. Sometimes bad things that happen to you are good things in disguise.</p>\n<p>What’s in my future? Well, one of my dreams is to get a Sprinter Van, have it customized for living on the road and drive cross country with Bella. Buster passed end of 2016 and Bella is my other life-saver. I’d love to drive cross country and stop and meet people I’ve met in the WordPress community. I know I can’t really make that happen, but I can dream, can’t I? LOL!</p>\n<p>I’d love to follow you on Twitter.

The date has not yet been set but the plan is to have it scheduled for summer 2019. </p>\n<p>The event will be divided into two tracks, one for kids aged 6 to 18 and another for teachers and educators. The kid&#8217;s track will include talks on WordPress, MineCraft, STEAM/STEM activities, and ways they can improve their coding skills. Teachers and educators will have a dedicated track with talks that will help them incorporate coding, WordPress, and broader STEAM/STEM activities into their curricula.</p>\n<p>In their <a href="https://2019.miami.wordcamp.org/kids-at-wordcamp-miami-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a>, WordCamp Miami&#8217;s organizers said they believe the next generation of WordPress users are &#8220;vital to the growth of the open web.&#8221; They are looking for sponsors to cover the costs of snacks and lunch for approximately 100 students, volunteers and speakers to give presentations on various subjects for kids and teachers, and people to spread the word to schools in the Dade/Broward area.</p>\n<p>Kids engaging with WordPress is one of the most inspiring things happening in the community right now. It&#8217;s the spark of a new generation of users who are embracing the concept of sharing their ideas on the open web. WordPress&#8217; Community team also has a new <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/kids-events/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kids Event Working Group</a> that kicked off last month to support the growth of these kinds of events around the world. They are currently working on documentation, training guides, legal documents, supply lists, and other resources.

Savchenko is one of the maintainers of this lesser-known component, which includes code that dates back to PHP 4 times. After volunteering for years in the WordPress Stack Exchange forums, he encountered some of the worst Date/Time bugs, eventually spurring him on to get involved improving the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From there it was a slow descent into the madness of the component,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;Much of my experience ended up in my <a href="https://github.com/Rarst/wpdatetime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WpDateTime library</a>. By last year I was, at last, confident I had a good grasp on the extent of the problem and a way forward for core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Date/Time issues affect both developers and users. Savchenko said most of the problems, by volume, are related to an incorrect output of localized time by `date_i18n()`. These things can trickle down to users and affect post scheduling, querying, and other operations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of them are outright bugs and some are easy to break due to incompatibility with Unix timestamps,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;But many other parts of the core have problems related to time &#8211; most often around time zones and daylight savings time. Posts can end up with the wrong time, not published when needed, sorted in the wrong order, and so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The requirement for backwards compatibility makes progress slow but Savchenko and fellow contributors shipped some of their work in the most recent release of WordPress. They will have more solutions available to pursue when the minimum required PHP version is bumped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In WordPress 5.1 we had shipped a set of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?component=Date%2FTime&milestone=5.1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">important fixes for documentation and some of the worst bugs in `date_i18n()`</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;At the moment we continue to work on outstanding issues and get ready to implement <a href="https://github.com/Rarst/wp-date/issues/4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a set of major new API functions</a>. The work on the component has also revitalized the discussion of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18146" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introducing user timezones</a>. However I think those need a lot of UX work to reach workable proposal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the video below for a quick overview of the work being done on the Date/Time component and find out how you can get involved at the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-datetime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#core-datetime</a> channel in WordPress Slack.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:04:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: GitHub Is Testing Commits on Behalf of Organizations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=88028";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"https://wptavern.com/github-is-testing-commits-on-behalf-of-organizations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2012:"<p>GitHub users may soon be able to <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-03-15-creating-a-commit-on-behalf-of-an-organization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contribute to projects on behalf of an organization</a>.

You reference our action in your plugin repo’s workflow file, filtered to only run when a tag is pushed, and set your username/password secrets. After that, each time you tag a new version on GitHub, whether by pushing a Git tag from the command line or making one using the GitHub releases interface, your plugin will be deployed to WordPress.org.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Developers who want to use this Action will need to <a href="https://github.com/features/actions/signup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sign up for beta access to GitHub Actions</a> in order to create their own Actions-enabled repo for pushing plugin releases to WordPress.org.

It is a new modal that can be launched from the vertical ellipses menu, inspired by Rich Tabor’s CoBlocks implementation. Users can turn individual blocks on/off or even entire sections, such as Common Blocks, Formatting, and Embeds. Block management should help users avoid the bloat that happens when installing block collections with more blocks than they need.  This version’s updates to the Cover Block make it possible to nest other blocks inside of it. Users can now add buttons, paragraphs, and headers to easily create a call to action. It’s not immediately evident that nesting blocks is possible, despite the floating inserter. It takes a little bit of time to discover that it is available. There are still some quirks with this feature, but overall it makes the Cover Block much more useful than previous versions.  A few contributors commenting on the Cover Block’s nesting PR said that it seems like the work on this iteration is essentially a light version of a section block. They questioned if it might be better to finish the work on the Section block (#4900) and build from there. Many developers and designers are eagerly awaiting the addition of a Section block to core, which will provide a standard for the plugin and theme industries to build on. “I think the cover block has very specific functionality that the section may not have like the focal point selector,” Automattic JavaScript engineer Jorge Costa said. “It is also important to note that the adjustments we make here to the way nesting works will also benefit a future section. This also allows us to test nesting a little bit more, before going to the section block. I expect the section block to be widely used in the community and will probably serve as a basis for many things being built in the future so it is important that we get it right. Exploring in cover will contribute to that.” Gutenberg 5.3 adds an experimental Legacy Widget Block that allows existing WordPress widgets to be added as Gutenberg blocks. It offers a dropdown of available widgets. After selecting one, the block populates that area with the widget’s settings.  This version also improves block outlines for the hover and selected states for a more accessible UI with less distraction. Performance benchmarks show a slight decrease in performance with Gutenberg 5.3. Check out the release post for a full list of enhancements and bug fixes. This is the last plugin release that will be rolled into the upcoming WordPress 5.2 release.''>WPTavern: Gutenberg 5.3 Introduces Block Management, Adds Nesting to the Cover Block</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''https://heropress.com/essays/sometimes-bad-things-that-happen-to-you-are-good-things-in-disguise/#utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=sometimes-bad-things-that-happen-to-you-are-good-things-in-disguise'' title=''My Mom used to say that things you remember from your past the most are things that had an impact on who you are today. Negative or positive, they affected you in a way that helped create the person you are. The Early Days Her father said to her, “Jean, you are always welcome but leave your kids at home.” That I will remember until the day I die. Why? We were biracial. My mother (who was White) left her home in Virginia to run away to Cleveland with my father (who was Black, and from West Virginia) to get married. That was in 1956. My father left us when I was about 8. Left us high and dry. The only positive thing I remember that he gave me was a typewriter. He said to me, “Teach yourself how to type and you’ll always be able to make a living.” I didn’t realize he “gave me anything” until after he died. After my second failed marriage, I moved my Mom in with me because she was ill. That was 2005 and that’s when my journey with WordPress began. I originally started using Joomla but found that it was too cumbersome to keep up-to-date because things needed to be done manually, whereas WordPress had this cool way of updating the plugins right inside the dashboard. I was hooked and left Joomla behind. I went back to work full time at one of the local hospitals. But not even a year into it I quit. One morning as I am waiting for the home health aide to arrive, my Mom started to cry and said, “I don’t want to die alone.” I stopped and looked at her and said, “You aren’t going to die alone.” That day, I got to work and one of the doctor’s pissed me off. I thought about what my Mom said and then starting thinking, “I don’t need this bullshit.” I went to my desk and started packing my things. My co-worker said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I quit.” She said, “What?” I said, “I quit.” The doctor ran out, “What are you doing and where are you going?” I said, “I quit, and you can kiss my ass!” I got home too early and my Mom asks, “Why are you home?” I just stood there. She looked at me and said, “Did you quit?” I started laughing, “Yep sure did and told that doctor he could kiss my ass!” She started giggling! “We’ll be okay.” she said. Shifting Gears At that moment I said I must take this hobby of building sites part time, to a full fledge business. I hunkered down in one of the upstairs bedrooms and started to write out my strategy. I had already completed a few small business websites, so I contacted them and from there and word of mouth, my business started to grow. But it wasn’t until after my Mom died that WordPress really saved my life. We were thick as thieves my Mom and me. She almost died having me. I had a sister (she died last April) but she wasn’t close to us and kept mainly to herself. But Mom and I…we were two peas in a pod all the way up to the day she died. I sat with her for five days in hospice and those were some of the longest days and nights of my life. I felt like someone dropped a weight on my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I felt faint. I felt lost. Thank God I had Buster, my dog. If it hadn’t been for him, I don’t know what I would have done. There was a night I just couldn’t bear not having my Mom. I had a bottle of Valium and thought, “I should just get it over with, go be with my Mom.” But I looked down at Buster and thought, “No one is going to take better care of him than me. I can’t do that to him.” I struggled with depression. Slowly over time I couldn’t function to even work on projects. It finally got to a point where my gas was turned off in the winter and I didn’t have food. I was bundled up with blankets and small heaters in my house to stay warm. Every penny I got, was basically food for Buster. One time I went 5 days without food. My car was repossessed. It was just crazy. Then I got evicted in mid-January 2013. Yep, evicted. My sister, who I wasn’t close to, had received a lump sum of money from Social Security. She sent money to me since I had cared for our Mom all that time by myself. I rented a van, packed up what I could fit in the U-Haul on my own and ended up at an Extended Stay hotel – in the middle of a blizzard. Left all my furniture behind because I didn’t have help. I got to the hotel and sat there in the U-Haul. I looked in the mirror and said out loud, “How the fuck did you get here? You don’t even have a pot to piss in!” Buster sitting in the other seat looking at me like I was crazy. That’s when I knew I had hit rock bottom. Depression led me to the bottom. Rising Up But… that was a good thing! I met a lot of wonderful people online. I joined a few WordPress groups, but mainly the StudioPress forum because I had been using their free themes when they were Revolution Two. Then they developed the Genesis Framework. Their old forum was a gold mine of information and the people were awesome. I learned so much from that forum. Every day from that point on was WordPress and Genesis. Meeting more people, learning more code. I was completely off the grid in that hotel room! No one here even knew where I was that’s how far off the grid I was. But sometimes, you must do that in order to focus and get back on track. There were a lot of bumps in that road the first year, too many to even write out in this essay, but I learned something from each bump. My business grew from word-of-mouth, I started getting work from people who needed help who saw me on social media and through the forums. Work from people all over the world. It truly was exciting. Each day is still WordPress and websites. Learning new things every day. Sitting with Slack windows open and chatting with other WordPress people online. It’s been my entire world since 2013 and pretty much my “Saving Grace” because I feel like I know some people online better than people right here in the same city where I live at. I lived in the hotel for 2 years. Not because I had to but because I wanted to. The Power of Communiity The WordPress community is awesome and giving. The Genesis community is the same. It feels like family and I’ve never met anyone in person but care so much about the people! I would hope that those who know me would feel the same. A friend recently shared a quote by the author Dodinsky that started off, “A lot of walking away will do your life good.” But it was the end that really caught my attention and it said, “The more you walk away from things that poison your soul, the healthier your life will be.” And that is so true. Healthier in a sense that I walked away from all the bad, negative things and people that were in my space. I was able to grieve and heal. Sometimes bad things that happen to you are good things in disguise. What’s in my future? Well, one of my dreams is to get a Sprinter Van, have it customized for living on the road and drive cross country with Bella. Buster passed end of 2016 and Bella is my other life-saver. I’d love to drive cross country and stop and meet people I’ve met in the WordPress community. I know I can’t really make that happen, but I can dream, can’t I? LOL! I’d love to follow you on Twitter. Follow me at @thecre8tivediva and I’ll follow you back!

WordCamp Miami has been hosting learning experiences for kids since 2014 and for the past four years has included a two-day Kid’s Camp along with a Kid’s Panel. More than 100 children (not including parents and guardians) attended this year’s event. Some of the kids who are more experienced with WordPress shared their experiences during the Kid’s Panel.   Kids reported that they using WordPress for blogs, science projects, and robotic competitions. One fifth grade student, who has been using WordPress for three years, said she plans to continue using it to document her life and share her future educational experiences: “I plan to be using it later in my life when I go to college, so I can be talking about what my life journey was and what I’m going to be studying, which is software engineering.”  Listen to how a 4th grader explains why she likes using #WordPress. #WCMIA pic.twitter.com/Zd5cRP3Afg — David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) March 17, 2019  Miami to Host New One-Day WordPress Event for Kids and Teachers The growing popularity of WordCamp Miami’s kids events has inspired organizers to host a new one-day event for kids and teachers. The date has not yet been set but the plan is to have it scheduled for summer 2019.  The event will be divided into two tracks, one for kids aged 6 to 18 and another for teachers and educators. The kid’s track will include talks on WordPress, MineCraft, STEAM/STEM activities, and ways they can improve their coding skills. Teachers and educators will have a dedicated track with talks that will help them incorporate coding, WordPress, and broader STEAM/STEM activities into their curricula. In their announcement, WordCamp Miami’s organizers said they believe the next generation of WordPress users are “vital to the growth of the open web.” They are looking for sponsors to cover the costs of snacks and lunch for approximately 100 students, volunteers and speakers to give presentations on various subjects for kids and teachers, and people to spread the word to schools in the Dade/Broward area. Kids engaging with WordPress is one of the most inspiring things happening in the community right now. It’s the spark of a new generation of users who are embracing the concept of sharing their ideas on the open web. WordPress’ Community team also has a new Kids Event Working Group that kicked off last month to support the growth of these kinds of events around the world. They are currently working on documentation, training guides, legal documents, supply lists, and other resources.

The Theme Sniffer plugin is a new effort from the Theme Review team that uses custom sniffs for PHP_CodeSniffer to test a theme against WordPress coding standards and check for PHP version compatibility.  The plugin is useful for both theme reviewers and developers who want to get their themes approved for the WordPress.org directory. It includes several optional standards to test against beyond the ruleset for theme review requirements. Passing the Theme Sniffer checks is not required for themes entering the directory but reviewers can use the plugin to speed the process up. The Accessibility Team also published a new tool called WP Theme Auditor that runs Axe tests against a theme for automated accessibility feedback. Axe is an open source library and testing engine created by the accessibility experts at Deque. The WP Theme Auditor package can be installed into a theme’s root directory. Developers can then add test cases. Examples are available in the project’s README file. The tests are run against http://one.wordpress.test by default but developers can specify a different test environment URL. The Accessibility team plans to expand the test cases in the tool to include all the content from the current Theme Unit Test Data package. In the most recent team meeting, they decided to recommend WP Theme Auditor as a WordPress testing tool and plan to post more details about it on the make.wordpress.org/accessibility blog.''>WPTavern: New Tools for Theme Developers: Theme Sniffer Plugin and Automated Accessibility Testing</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''https://wptavern.com/a-quick-introduction-to-wordpress-date-time-component'' title=''At WordCamp Nordic’s contributor day I had the opportunity to chat with Andrey “Rarst” Savchenko about WordPress’ Date/Time component, the code that manages date, time, and timezone functionality. Savchenko is one of the maintainers of this lesser-known component, which includes code that dates back to PHP 4 times. After volunteering for years in the WordPress Stack Exchange forums, he encountered some of the worst Date/Time bugs, eventually spurring him on to get involved improving the code. “From there it was a slow descent into the madness of the component,” Savchenko said. “Much of my experience ended up in my WpDateTime library. By last year I was, at last, confident I had a good grasp on the extent of the problem and a way forward for core.” Date/Time issues affect both developers and users. Savchenko said most of the problems, by volume, are related to an incorrect output of localized time by `date_i18n()`. These things can trickle down to users and affect post scheduling, querying, and other operations. “Some of them are outright bugs and some are easy to break due to incompatibility with Unix timestamps,” Savchenko said. “But many other parts of the core have problems related to time – most often around time zones and daylight savings time. Posts can end up with the wrong time, not published when needed, sorted in the wrong order, and so on.” The requirement for backwards compatibility makes progress slow but Savchenko and fellow contributors shipped some of their work in the most recent release of WordPress. They will have more solutions available to pursue when the minimum required PHP version is bumped. “In WordPress 5.1 we had shipped a set of important fixes for documentation and some of the worst bugs in `date_i18n()`.  “At the moment we continue to work on outstanding issues and get ready to implement a set of major new API functions. The work on the component has also revitalized the discussion of introducing user timezones. However I think those need a lot of UX work to reach workable proposal.” Check out the video below for a quick overview of the work being done on the Date/Time component and find out how you can get involved at the #core-datetime channel in WordPress Slack.

Updated versions of WordPress 5.0 and earlier are also available for any users who have not yet updated to 5.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Props to&nbsp;Simon Scannell of RIPS Technologies who discovered this flaw independent of some work that was being done by members of the core security team. Thank you to all of the reporters for&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">privately disclosing the vulnerabilities</a>, which gave us time to fix them before WordPress sites could be attacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other highlights of this release include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hosts can now offer a button for their users to update PHP.</li><li>The recommended PHP version used by the &#8220;Update PHP&#8221; notice can now be filtered.</li><li>Several minor bug fixes.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can browse the&nbsp;<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=5.1.1&amp;order=priority">full list of changes on Trac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1.1 was a short-cycle maintenance release. <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=5.1.2">Version 5.1.2</a> is expected to follow a similar two week release cadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&nbsp;download <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress 5.1.1</a>&nbsp;or visit <strong>Dashboard → Updates</strong> and click&nbsp;<strong>Update Now</strong>. Sites that support automatic background updates have already started to update automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the security researcher mentioned above, thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 5.1.1:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/xknown/">Alex Concha</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/afercia/">Andrea Fercia</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/afragen/">Andy Fragen</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/vanyukov/">Anton Vanyukov</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/vortfu/">Ben Bidner</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/bulletdigital/">bulletdigital</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidbinda/">David Binovec</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32/">Dion Hulse</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/flixos90/">Felix Arntz</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/garrett-eclipse/">Garrett Hyder</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/pento/">Gary Pendergast</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/">Ian Dunn</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/whyisjake/">Jake Spurlock</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/">Jb Audras</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeremyfelt/">Jeremy Felt</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/j-falk/">Johan Falk</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/">Jonathan Desrosiers</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukecarbis/">Luke Carbis</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikeschroder/">Mike Schroder</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dimadin/">Milan Dinić</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mukesh27/">Mukesh Panchal</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/pbiron/">Paul Biron</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/peterwilsoncc/">Peter Wilson</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/sergeybiryukov/">Sergey Biryukov</a>, and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/">Weston Ruter</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"6736";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:48:"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"The Month in WordPress: February 2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/the-month-in-wordpress-february-2019/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Mar 2019 10:00:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Month in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6652";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:363:"A new version of WordPress, significant security enhancements, important discussions, and much more &#8211; read on to find out what has been going on in the WordPress community for the month of February.

The first phase of Gutenberg resulted in the block editor that was included in WordPress 5.0, but development didn’t stop there &#8211; <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/">phase 2 of the project is well underway</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, one of the initial goals for this phase was reached with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/18/porting-widgets-to-blocks-feb-18-2019/">all of the core WordPress widgets being converted to blocks</a> &#8211; this will go a long way to allowing full sites to be built using blocks, rather than simply post or page content.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in developing Gutenberg? Check out <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg">the GitHub repository</a> and join the #core-editor channel in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor Comes to the Mobile Apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Gutenberg development continues, the Mobile team has been working hard to integrate the new block editor into <a href="https://wordpress.org/mobile/">the WordPress mobile apps</a>. Near the end of February, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/">the team shipped a complete integration in the beta versions of the apps</a> &#8211; this a significant milestone and a big step towards unifying the mobile and desktop editing experiences.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the iOS and Android apps are open for beta testers, so if you would like to experience the block editor on mobile today, then <a href="https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/">join the beta program</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in developing the WordPress mobile apps?

Foods that are high in sugar and refined flours (think sodas, baked goods, etc.) are a common source of excess calories in the diet, as many people find it hard to limit the intake of such foods.These foods also can lead to dramatic blood sugar elevations in some people, which can have a negative affect on heart health.\n\nMany people get frustrated and find it nearly impossible to change their habits, but it is not common knowledge that different lifestyle factors can affect impulse control and ability to make better choices. A study recently published in the journal Sleep compared 2 groups of people; one group had 5 nights of 9.5 hours of sleep opportunity, the other group had 5 nights of 6.5 hours of sleep opportunity. The 6.5 hour group consistently ate more added sugar, foods with higher glycemic load (this is basically the load of carbohydrate that causes a rise in blood sugar; higher glycemic load means it causes a more dramatic blood sugar elevation), drank more sweet drinks, and ate less vegetables and fruit. There were also differences seen in total fat and calories consumed. It should be noted that the test subjects in this study were adolescents, but there is no reason to think it doesn''t apply to older individuals, plus there have been studies on other age ranges finding that choice-making was worse after sleep deprivation.\n\nAnother reason why this is a problem is that shorter sleep tends to lead to more dramatic blood sugar responses to meals compared to when a person is well-rested.\n\nIf you''re looking to improve your eating habits, you have to make better choices. A well-rested brain is much better at higher order thinking, and therefore breaking old habits, than a chronically sleep-deprived brain.\n\nGood habits to promote sleep include:\n\n- Avoid bright lights at night, especially LED (such as those found in tv, computer, and phone screens) and fluorescent lights that are bright-white or bluish in color.\n\n- See bright light in the morning. A morning walk is a great way to do this. Caution: Do not ever look straight at the sun.\n\n- Do not eat too close to bed.\n\n- Do not exercise intensely too close to bed.\n\n- Consider meditating in the evening.\n\n- Cool your home off at night. Studies have found that temperature range of 68-72 degrees can promote sound sleep.\n\nSource:\nDuraccio KM, Whitacre C, Krietsch KN, Zhang N, Summer S, Price M, Saelens BE, Beebe DW.

To begin a meditation practice, you will need to find a quiet spot, away from the phone, television, friends, family, and other distractions. There are several different ways to meditate. Meditation practices often involve learning chanting, breathing, or mantra techniques. Initially, your mind may wander when you first start meditating. by training your mind to focus on the moment, you will eventually find yourself transformed and feel very peaceful and content. Most experts recommend mediating for about 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Beginners may find it difficult to meditate for this length at first, but don’t despair. It will become easier once you are meditating regularly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Biofeedback</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">This method involves attaching surface electromyography electrodes (SEMG) to your skin. The SEMG measures your blood pressure, muscle tension level, breathing, and heart rate. A biofeedback therapist will meet with you and show you the ways in which your body reacts on a computer screen.

Yoga has been practiced in India for over 5,000 years. Yoga involves repeating movements that can help improve strength and flexibility as well as promote mental and physical health and greater self-understanding. The movements are very graceful and have spiritual significance. Paying careful attention to breathing is also part of practicing yoga.

It has been used effectively for cancer patients who literally imagine themselves without the cancerous cells. Other creative visualization techniques include transporting the individual to a quiet place in their mind (perhaps a favorite lake, river, or forest). You can either create your own special place or listen to a guided imagery tape or CD. According to the Guided Imagery Resource Center, guided imagery can “reduce blood pressure, lower cholesterol and glucose levels in the blood and heighten short-term immune cell activity.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Deep Breathing</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Deep breathing exercises are also known as diaphragmatic breathing.

Even\n	though it is common to see people meditating while sitting on a flat\n	surface, do not force yourself to sit on a flat surface if you are\n	unable to do so safely, or if you might not be able to stand up\n	safely from there when you are finished. \n	\n	</li><li>Close your\n	eyes.\n	</li><li>Take several\n	deep breaths.

To begin a meditation practice, you will need to find a quiet spot, away from the phone, television, friends, family, and other distractions. There are several different ways to meditate. Meditation practices often involve learning chanting, breathing, or mantra techniques. Initially, your mind may wander when you first start meditating. by training your mind to focus on the moment, you will eventually find yourself transformed and feel very peaceful and content. Most experts recommend mediating for about 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Beginners may find it difficult to meditate for this length at first, but don’t despair. It will become easier once you are meditating regularly.</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Biofeedback</span></span>\n\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">This method involves attaching surface electromyography electrodes (SEMG) to your skin. The SEMG measures your blood pressure, muscle tension level, breathing, and heart rate. A biofeedback therapist will meet with you and show you the ways in which your body reacts on a computer screen. The therapist will then teach you new skills for decreasing the level of stress you are experiencing. The results are shown on the screen.</span>\n\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Biofeedback is taught by a psychologist or specialized therapist who has been trained in biofeedback techniques. Most insurance plans cover biofeedback treatment for recognized anxiety problems. Avoid any consumer-level biofeedback devices that claim to give you the same information as a professional device. The device itself isn’t as important as what the professionals helps you learn through repeated training sessions.</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Yoga</span></span>\n\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Yoga combines meditation and physical exercise to achieve improved health and sense of well-being. Yoga has been practiced in India for over 5,000 years. Yoga involves repeating movements that can help improve strength and flexibility as well as promote mental and physical health and greater self-understanding. The movements are very graceful and have spiritual significance. Paying careful attention to breathing is also part of practicing yoga. Yoga is best learned in a local class that teaches yoga techniques. After you learn yoga, you can do it in the privacy and comfort of your own home.</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Guided Imagery</span></span>\n\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Guided Imagery is a wonderful stress reduction tool which uses “visualization” and “mental imagery” techniques to improve health. It has been used effectively for cancer patients who literally imagine themselves without the cancerous cells. Other creative visualization techniques include transporting the individual to a quiet place in their mind (perhaps a favorite lake, river, or forest). You can either create your own special place or listen to a guided imagery tape or CD.

To begin a meditation practice, you will need to find a quiet spot, away from the phone, television, friends, family, and other distractions. There are several different ways to meditate. Meditation practices often involve learning chanting, breathing, or mantra techniques. Initially, your mind may wander when you first start meditating. by training your mind to focus on the moment, you will eventually find yourself transformed and feel very peaceful and content. Most experts recommend mediating for about 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Beginners may find it difficult to meditate for this length at first, but don’t despair. It will become easier once you are meditating regularly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Biofeedback</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">This method involves attaching surface electromyography electrodes (SEMG) to your skin. The SEMG measures your blood pressure, muscle tension level, breathing, and heart rate. A biofeedback therapist will meet with you and show you the ways in which your body reacts on a computer screen. The therapist will then teach you new skills for decreasing the level of stress you are experiencing. The results are shown on the screen.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Biofeedback is taught by a psychologist or specialized therapist who has been trained in biofeedback techniques. Most insurance plans cover biofeedback treatment for recognized anxiety problems. Avoid any consumer-level biofeedback devices that claim to give you the same information as a professional device. The device itself isn’t as important as what the professionals helps you learn through repeated training sessions.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Yoga</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Yoga combines meditation and physical exercise to achieve improved health and sense of well-being. Yoga has been practiced in India for over 5,000 years. Yoga involves repeating movements that can help improve strength and flexibility as well as promote mental and physical health and greater self-understanding. The movements are very graceful and have spiritual significance. Paying careful attention to breathing is also part of practicing yoga. Yoga is best learned in a local class that teaches yoga techniques. After you learn yoga, you can do it in the privacy and comfort of your own home.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Guided Imagery</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Guided Imagery is a wonderful stress reduction tool which uses “visualization” and “mental imagery” techniques to improve health. It has been used effectively for cancer patients who literally imagine themselves without the cancerous cells. Other creative visualization techniques include transporting the individual to a quiet place in their mind (perhaps a favorite lake, river, or forest). You can either create your own special place or listen to a guided imagery tape or CD. According to the Guided Imagery Resource Center, guided imagery can “reduce blood pressure, lower cholesterol and glucose levels in the blood and heighten short-term immune cell activity.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Deep Breathing</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Deep breathing exercises are also known as diaphragmatic breathing.

A good breakfast will get in some important nutrients, get your metabolism going and set the tone for the rest of the day.</li><li><strong>Soup Up Your Meal Plan</strong>: You can count on soup to fill you up with low-calorie, nutrient-dense vegetables. Make a big pot on the weekend and you''ll have it on hand for lunch or dinner throughout the week.</li><li><strong>Resist Workplace Temptations</strong>: No doubt about it: There will be more candies, cookies and cake staring you in the face at the office during the holiday season. Again, take the long view. Special treats aren''t so special when you start to have them every day. Save your calories for the sweets you really don''t want to miss.</li><li><strong>Reward Yourself</strong>: One of the reasons we get so tempted by the abundance of sweets is that the holidays can be stressful, and indulging is one way to a hit of dopamine (the feel-good hormone) to the brain. Get your dopamine fix with other non-food-related rewards by, say, treating yourself to a massage, heading to a yoga class, taking a bath or carving out time to read a good book.</li><li><strong>Bring a Veggie Dish</strong>: "Be the change you want to see in the world" doesn''t just apply to how you treat others. It also applies to the food you want to eat. Make sure there''s something healthy at a holiday party by offering to bring a vegetable-centric dish.</li><li><strong>Sip Seltzer or Water</strong>: Many people tend to let loose this time of year and dip into holiday spirits. While a single drink can be a modest indulgence, having two or more can be like eating an extra dinner. Slow your pace by alternating a cocktail with a glass of seltzer or water.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Foodnetwork.com</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'How to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1309-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-12-04 22:21:14', '2019-12-04 22:21:14', '', 1309, 'http://www.drjchen.com/blog/?p=1315', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

They protect the lining of your intestines and\nensure they provide a strong barrier against toxins and “bad” bacteria; they\nlimit inflammation; they improve how well you absorb nutrients from your food;\nand they activate neural pathways that travel directly between the gut and the\nbrain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Studies have\ncompared “traditional” diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the traditional\nJapanese diet, to a typical “Western” diet and have shown that the risk of\ndepression is 25% to 35% lower in those who eat a traditional diet. Scientists\naccount for this difference because these traditional diets tend to be high in\nvegetables, fruits, unprocessed grains, and fish and seafood, and to contain\nonly modest amounts of lean meats and dairy. They are also void of processed\nand refined foods and sugars, which are staples of the “Western” dietary\npattern. In addition, many of these unprocessed foods are fermented, and\ntherefore act as natural probiotics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This may\nsound implausible to you, but the notion that good bacteria not only influence\nwhat your gut digests and absorbs, but that they also affect the degree of\ninflammation throughout your body, as well as your mood and energy level, is\ngaining traction among researchers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Start paying attention to how eating different foods makes you feel — not just in the moment, but the next day. Try eating a “clean” diet for two to three weeks — that means cutting out all processed foods and sugar. See how you feel. Then slowly introduce foods back into your diet, one by one, and see how you feel. When some people “go clean,” they cannot believe how much better they feel both physically and emotionally, and how much worse they then feel when they reintroduce the foods that are known to enhance inflammation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>www.health.harvard.edu</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Your Brain on Food', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1350-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-06-01 17:34:55', '2020-06-01 17:34:55', '', 1350, 'http://www.drjchen.com/blog/?p=1351', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Foods that are high in sugar and refined flours (think sodas, baked goods, etc.) are a common source of excess calories in the diet, as many people find it hard to limit the intake of such foods.These foods also can lead to dramatic blood sugar elevations in some people, which can have a negative affect on heart health. \r\n\r\nMany people are working on improving their habits, but it is not common knowledge that different lifestyle factors can affect impulse control and ability to choose better foods. A recent study published in the journal Sleep compared 2 groups of people; one group had 5 nights of 9.5 hours of sleep opportunity, the other group had 5 nights of 6.5 hours of sleep opportunity. The 6.5 hour group consistently ate more added sugar, foods with higher glycemic load (this is basically the load of carbohydrate that causes a rise in blood sugar; higher glycemic load means it causes a more dramatic blood sugar elevation), drank more sweet drinks, and ate less vegetables and fruit. There were also differences seen in total fat and calories consumed. It should be noted that the test subjects in this study were adolescents, but there is no reason to think it doesn''t apply to older individuals, plus there have been studies on other age ranges finding that choice-making was worse after sleep deprivation.  \r\n\r\nAnother reason why this is a problem is that shorter sleep tends to lead to more dramatic blood sugar responses to meals compared to when a person is well-rested. \r\n\r\nIf you''re looking to improve your eating habits, you have to make better choices. A well-rested brain is much better at higher order thinking, and therefore breaking old habits, than a chronically sleep-deprived brain. \r\n\r\nGood habits to promote sleep include: \r\n\r\n- Avoid bright lights at night, especially LED (such as those found in tv, computer, and phone screens) and fluorescent lights that are bright-white or bluish in color.   \r\n\r\n- See bright light in the morning.

Heart health and metabolic health are closely related, and are usually referred to collectively as “cardiometabolic health”. In total, 29 studies that together included over 1500 participants were looked at to investigate trends in their findings. All of these studies were randomized clinical control trials, which are generally accepted to be the gold standard in research (2).\n\nConsistent findings were reductions LDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, bodyweight, and body mass index (BMI, which is the ratio of weight to height), A1c (marker of average blood sugar over 3 months), fasting blood sugar levels, and a primary marker of inflammation know as CRP (2). When excessively elevated, these things are associated with worse cardiometabolic health.\n\nYears before this study was done, studies looking into this topic were being carried out. In fact, in 2013, a scientific summit was held in Italy comprised of international experts on carbohydrate research, and they decided together that it was important to teach the public what low-glycemic means, and how minding this way of eating can help to improve and maintain health (3). Let’s take a look at what what “low-glycemic” means.\n\nThe word “glycemic” relates to glucose, the type of sugar that circulates in the blood and that cells use as energy. For example, “glycemia” is the level of sugar in your blood. A low-glycemic meal is a meal that leads to only small to moderate elevations in blood sugar. The term “low-glycemic” includes 2 main factors: glycemic index, and glycemic load. Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how much a given amount of food causes blood sugar to rise after eating, and glycemic load takes into account both the glycemic index, as well as the amount of carbohydrate (in grams) contained in a volume of food.\n\nExample: an apple is low on the glycemic index, and has a low glycemic load. However, if 8 apples are eaten in a sitting, the glycemic load becomes high.\n\nThere are lists that show the glycemic indexes and glycemic loads of different foods, but here are the main things you need to know without having to consult such a list. The group of foods that tends to cause blood sugar elevations after eating is called carbohydrate, a term that generally refers to foods containing mostly starch, sugar, and sometimes fiber. Fiber is not absorbed by the body for energy, so it is does not cause blood sugar elevations. This is a key point: while there are exceptions, the trend is that low- and medium-glycemic carbohydrates tend to contain some fiber, and are often non-processed. These are foods such as vegetables, beans, fruit, and whole grains. The lowest glycemic foods from this group are called non-starchy vegetables, and they include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, lettuce and other leafy greens, asparagus, beets, yellow squash, zucchini, onion, tomato, cucumber, green beans, and a few other less-commonly eaten veggies. High-glycemic carbohydrates tend to be low in fiber, highly processed, and contain refined flours and added sugars.\n\nrotein-rich foods, such as fish, seafood, chicken, eggs, etc., are usually listed as zero or close to it on glycemic charts. This is also true for foods that are predominantly fat; foods such as nuts, olive oil, avocado, and others.\n\nTaken together, this means that a plate with low to medium glycemic carbohydrate component, some protein, and some healthy fat will generally cause a relatively low-glycemic response (aka blood sugar response). Remember that glycemic load takes into account both the glycemic index, as well as the amount of carbohydrate (starch or sugar; we don’t count fiber) in the given food. In other word, the amount of starch and/or sugar that you eat affects the glycemic effect of the meal. This means that eating a large dinner plate piled high with only whole-grain brown rice, red beans, and 2 whole grain rolls would push the meal into the high-glycemic range, because the glycemic load would be so high. Rather, if the goal is to eat a lower glycemic meal, the red beans and rice might take up 1/4 to 1/3 of the plate, and you would also have some roasted chicken, and a non-starchy vegetable perhaps roasted in a bit of olive oil to add healthy fats to the meal.\n\nFeel free to reach out with questions.

Foods that are high in sugar and refined flours (think sodas, baked goods, etc.) are a common source of excess calories in the diet, as many people find it hard to limit the intake of such foods.These foods also can lead to dramatic blood sugar elevations in some people, which can have a negative affect on heart health.\n\nMany people get frustrated and find it nearly impossible to change their habits, but it is not common knowledge that different lifestyle factors can affect impulse control and ability to make better choices. A study recently published in the journal Sleep compared 2 groups of people; one group had 5 nights of 9.5 hours of sleep opportunity, the other group had 5 nights of 6.5 hours of sleep opportunity. The 6.5 hour group consistently ate more added sugar, foods with higher glycemic load (this is basically the load of carbohydrate that causes a rise in blood sugar; higher glycemic load means it causes a more dramatic blood sugar elevation), drank more sweet drinks, and ate less vegetables and fruit.

Heart health and metabolic health are closely related, and are usually referred to collectively as “cardiometabolic health”. In total, 29 studies that together included over 1500 participants were looked at to investigate trends in their findings. All of these studies were randomized clinical control trials, which are generally accepted to be the gold standard in research (2).\r\n\r\nConsistent findings were reductions LDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, bodyweight, and body mass index (BMI, which is the ratio of weight to height), A1c (marker of average blood sugar over 3 months), fasting blood sugar levels, and a primary marker of inflammation know as CRP (2). When excessively elevated, these things are associated with worse cardiometabolic health. \r\n\r\nYears before this study was done, studies looking into this topic were being carried out. In fact, in 2013, a scientific summit was held in Italy comprised of international experts on carbohydrate research, and they decided together that it was important to teach the public what low-glycemic means, and how minding this way of eating can help to improve and maintain health (3). Let’s take a look at what what “low-glycemic” means. \r\n\r\nThe word “glycemic” relates to glucose, the type of sugar that circulates in the blood and that cells use as energy. For example, “glycemia” is the level of sugar in your blood. A low-glycemic meal is a meal that leads to only small to moderate elevations in blood sugar. The term “low-glycemic” includes 2 main factors: glycemic index, and glycemic load. Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how much a given amount of food causes blood sugar to rise after eating, and glycemic load takes into account both the glycemic index, as well as the amount of carbohydrate (in grams) contained in a volume of food. \r\n\r\nExample: an apple is low on the glycemic index, and has a low glycemic load. However, if 8 apples are eaten in a sitting, the glycemic load becomes high.  \r\n\r\nThere are lists that show the glycemic indexes and glycemic loads of different foods, but here are the main things you need to know without having to consult such a list. The group of foods that tends to cause blood sugar elevations after eating is called carbohydrate, a term that generally refers to foods containing mostly starch, sugar, and sometimes fiber. Fiber is not absorbed by the body for energy, so it is does not cause blood sugar elevations. This is a key point: while there are exceptions, the trend is that low- and medium-glycemic carbohydrates tend to contain some fiber, and are often non-processed. These are foods such as vegetables, beans, fruit, and whole grains. The lowest glycemic foods from this group are called non-starchy vegetables, and they include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, lettuce and other leafy greens, asparagus, beets, yellow squash, zucchini, onion, tomato, cucumber, green beans, and a few other less-commonly eaten veggies. High-glycemic carbohydrates tend to be low in fiber, highly processed, and contain refined flours and added sugars. \r\n\r\nrotein-rich foods, such as fish, seafood, chicken, eggs, etc., are usually listed as zero or close to it on glycemic charts. This is also true for foods that are predominantly fat; foods such as nuts, olive oil, avocado, and others. \r\n\r\nTaken together, this means that a plate with low to medium glycemic carbohydrate component, some protein, and some healthy fat will generally cause a relatively low-glycemic response (aka blood sugar response). Remember that glycemic load takes into account both the glycemic index, as well as the amount of carbohydrate (starch or sugar; we don’t count fiber) in the given food. In other word, the amount of starch and/or sugar that you eat affects the glycemic effect of the meal. This means that eating a large dinner plate piled high with only whole-grain brown rice, red beans, and 2 whole grain rolls would push the meal into the high-glycemic range, because the glycemic load would be so high. Rather, if the goal is to eat a lower glycemic meal, the red beans and rice might take up 1/4 to 1/3 of the plate, and you would also have some roasted chicken, and a non-starchy vegetable perhaps roasted in a bit of olive oil to add healthy fats to the meal. \r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out with questions.
